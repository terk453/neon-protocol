# 🌌 PROJECT: ZERO SIGNAL

> “Every line of code starts with silence.”

Welcome to **Zero Signal**, the digital space where ideas turn into motion.  
No rules, no boundaries — just pure creation and chaos perfectly balanced.

### 🧠 Concept
This isn’t just another repo.  
It’s a signal in the static — a test, a thought, a beginning.  
Every commit is a breadcrumb on the path to something bigger.




### ⚙️ Core Values
- Build without fear  
- Break things beautifully  
- Learn by doing  
- Stay curious  

### 🧩 Current Status
